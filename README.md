# Object_detection_YOLOv5

This is a mini project using YOLOv5 technique for real time object detection with the concept of transfer learning. 

### Data extraction
Few datasets were manually downloaded from wikipedia using Fatkun chrome extension to download the images in Batch. 

### Data Annotation
Used (makesense.ai) to label the images into 3 classes. 

###### Classes
  - 0: Hen
  - 1: Cock
  - 2: Chicks

### Git Clone Yolov5 repository to install all dependencies
Go to [Yolov5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/) and Click “open in colab” on the page.
